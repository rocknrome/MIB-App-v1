Accomplished so far:

1. **Backend Setup with Express**: We set up a Node.js backend using Express, including full CRUD operations for multiple entities (clients, jobs, job types, plantations, team assignments, team members, teams).

2. **Kafka Integration**: We integrated Kafka into the controllers to handle event-driven architecture, ensuring data consistency and scalability across the application.

3. **WebSocket Integration**: We added WebSocket functionality to the controllers, allowing for real-time updates to be broadcasted to the frontend whenever CRUD operations occur.

4. **Code Organization**: We organized the code structure, ensuring that configurations (like WebSocket and Kafka) are cleanly separated, making the project more maintainable.

Next steps involve testing, frontend integration, and potentially deploying the application.
