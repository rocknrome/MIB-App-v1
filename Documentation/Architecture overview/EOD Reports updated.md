Let's review the requirements for the two reports to ensure we haven't missed anything and to check if there are any additional details that need to be included.

### Daily Report

**Requirements:**
1. Team member name
2. Team member hourly rate for today based on the role (Supervisor/Helper)
3. Total number of hours that team member worked today
4. Total amount of tips received by that team member today
5. Summary column that shows total salary for all team members worked today and total amount of tips received by all team members worked today
6. Summary column that shows total number of jobs completed today

### Payments Report

**Requirements:**
1. Total number of jobs completed that day.
2. Each individual job listed with a mark if it has been paid or not.
3. Method of payment listed for each individual job (paid or not).
4. Jobs that have been paid will be colored in green, with listed method of payment.
5. Jobs that are marked as "not paid yet" will be highlighted in yellow.
6. Jobs that have not been marked as "paid" will be available to send a notification as a text message (SMS) to the corresponding client with a reminder to pay.

### Updates and Additions to Reports

Let's ensure all these details are covered:

#### Daily Report

1. **Track each team member's hours and pay based on their role (Supervisor/Helper)**:
   - Include hourly rate.
   - Include total hours worked.
   - Calculate total salary (hours worked * hourly rate).
   - Include total tips received.

2. **Summary of total salary and total tips**:
   - Calculate the sum of all salaries.
   - Calculate the sum of all tips.
   - Total number of jobs completed.

#### Payments Report

1. **Track job completion and payment status**:
   - Mark if the job has been paid or not.
   - List the method of payment for each job.
   - Highlight paid jobs in green.
   - Highlight unpaid jobs in yellow.
   - Include a mechanism to send SMS notifications for unpaid jobs.

### Function to Generate Daily Report

Here is the function again, with some refinements and comments for clarity:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_daily_report() RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    current_date DATE := CURRENT_DATE;
    team_member RECORD;
    job RECORD;
    total_jobs_completed INT;
    hours_worked NUMERIC(5, 2);
    hourly_rate NUMERIC(5, 2);
    total_salary NUMERIC(10, 2);
    total_tips_received NUMERIC(10, 2);
    total_salary_all NUMERIC(10, 2) := 0;
    total_tips_all NUMERIC(10, 2) := 0;
    total_jobs_all INT := 0;
BEGIN
    -- Calculate total jobs completed
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_jobs_completed
    FROM jobs
    WHERE job_date = current_date AND completion_status = TRUE;

    -- Insert total jobs completed into daily_reports table
    INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, team_member_name, role, hourly_rate, total_hours_worked, total_tips_received, total_salary)
    VALUES (current_date, 'Summary', 'N/A', 0, 0, total_tips_all, total_salary_all);

    -- Iterate over each team member
    FOR team_member IN
        SELECT tm.id, tm.name, ta.role
        FROM team_members tm
        JOIN team_assignments ta ON tm.id = ta.team_member_id
        WHERE ta.assignment_date = current_date
    LOOP
        -- Calculate hours worked
        SELECT SUM(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (end_time - start_time)) / 3600) INTO hours_worked
        FROM jobs
        WHERE team_id IN (
            SELECT team_id FROM team_assignments WHERE team_member_id = team_member.id AND assignment_date = current_date
        ) AND job_date = current_date AND completion_status = TRUE;

        -- Determine hourly rate based on role
        IF team_member.role = 'Supervisor' THEN
            hourly_rate := 21;
        ELSE
            hourly_rate := 19;
        END IF;

        -- Calculate total salary
        total_salary := hours_worked * hourly_rate;

        -- Calculate tips
        total_tips_received := 0;
        FOR job IN
            SELECT j.payment_amount
            FROM jobs j
            WHERE j.team_id IN (
                SELECT team_id FROM team_assignments WHERE team_member_id = team_member.id AND assignment_date = current_date
            ) AND j.job_date = current_date AND j.completion_status = TRUE
        LOOP
            IF job.payment_amount IS NOT NULL THEN
                total_tips_received := total_tips_received + ((job.payment_amount - 120) / 2); -- Assuming a static job cost of $120
            END IF;
        END LOOP;

        -- Insert data into daily_reports table
        INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, team_member_name, role, hourly_rate, total_hours_worked, total_tips_received, total_salary)
        VALUES (current_date, team_member.name, team_member.role, hourly_rate, hours_worked, total_tips_received, total_salary);

        -- Accumulate totals for summary
        total_salary_all := total_salary_all + total_salary;
        total_tips_all := total_tips_all + total_tips_received;
    END LOOP;

    -- Insert summary row into daily_reports table
    INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, team_member_name, role, hourly_rate, total_hours_worked, total_tips_received, total_salary)
    VALUES (current_date, 'Summary', 'N/A', 0, 0, total_tips_all, total_salary_all);

    -- Insert total jobs completed into daily_reports table (separate row for clarity)
    INSERT INTO daily_reports (report_date, team_member_name, role, hourly_rate, total_hours_worked, total_tips_received, total_salary)
    VALUES (current_date, 'Total Jobs Completed', 'N/A', 0, total_jobs_completed, 0, 0);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Function to Generate Payments Report

This function will generate the payments report and handle unpaid job notifications.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_payments_report() RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    current_date DATE := CURRENT_DATE;
    job RECORD;
    total_jobs_completed INT;
BEGIN
    -- Calculate total jobs completed
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_jobs_completed
    FROM jobs
    WHERE job_date = current_date AND completion_status = TRUE;

    -- Insert total jobs completed into payments_reports table
    INSERT INTO payments_reports (report_date, job_description)
    VALUES (current_date, 'Total Jobs Completed: ' || total_jobs_completed);

    -- Iterate over each job
    FOR job IN
        SELECT j.id, j.client_id, j.job_date, j.address, j.is_paid, j.payment_method
        FROM jobs j
        WHERE j.job_date = current_date AND j.completion_status = TRUE
    LOOP
        -- Insert job details into payments_reports table
        INSERT INTO payments_reports (report_date, job_id, client_id, job_date, job_description, is_paid, payment_method)
        VALUES (current_date, job.id, job.client_id, job.job_date, job.address, job.is_paid, job.payment_method);

        -- Send notification for unpaid jobs
        IF job.is_paid = FALSE THEN
            PERFORM send_payment_reminder(job.client_id, job.id);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Function to Send Payment Reminder

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION send_payment_reminder(client_id INT, job_id INT) RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    client RECORD;
    job RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Get client and job details
    SELECT * INTO client FROM clients WHERE id = client_id;
    SELECT * INTO job FROM jobs WHERE id = job_id;

    -- Send SMS (this is a placeholder; actual implementation will depend on the SMS service used)
    PERFORM send_sms(client.phone, 'Reminder: Please pay for your job completed on ' || job.job_date || '.');

    -- Update notification_sent in payments_reports table
    UPDATE payments_reports
    SET notification_sent = TRUE
    WHERE job_id = job_id AND report_date = CURRENT_DATE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Setting Up pg_cron

```sql
-- Install pg_cron extension (if not already installed)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

-- Schedule the generate_payments_report function to run daily at 6 PM
SELECT cron.schedule('generate_payments_report', '0 18 * * *', 'CALL generate_payments_report()');
```

### Summary

The functions and tables provided should cover all aspects of the two reports:
- The **Daily Report** includes team member details, hours worked, pay calculations, and tips.
- The **Payments Report** includes job payment status, methods of payment, and highlights unpaid jobs with the option to send SMS reminders.
