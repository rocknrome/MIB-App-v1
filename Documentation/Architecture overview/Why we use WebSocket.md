**Adding WebSocket into equation**

Adding WebSocket to our system serves a different purpose compared to Kafka. While Kafka is great for ensuring data integrity and handling asynchronous processing across different parts of our system, WebSocket is used primarily for real-time communication between the server and the client (usually a web or mobile application). Hereâ€™s why we might need WebSocket:

1. **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket enables real-time updates to be pushed from the server to the client without the client having to request new data. For example, if a job status changes or a new task is assigned, the client can be immediately notified and update the UI accordingly.

2. **Bidirectional Communication**: Unlike traditional HTTP, which is request-response-based, WebSocket allows for full-duplex communication. This means both the server and the client can send messages to each other independently. This is particularly useful in scenarios like live chats, notifications, or real-time dashboards.

3. **Reduced Latency**: Since WebSocket maintains an open connection between the server and client, it reduces the latency involved in making a new HTTP request each time data needs to be updated.

4. **Efficient Resource Use**: WebSocket connections are more efficient than repeatedly opening and closing HTTP connections, especially when frequent communication is needed. This reduces overhead and can improve performance in real-time applications.

With WebSocket, we don't need to write separate JavaScript code to manually fetch and render data every time a change occurs in our web application. Here's how it works:

1. **Persistent Connection**: Once a WebSocket connection is established between the client and the server, it remains open. This allows the server to push updates to the client whenever there is a change in the data, without the client needing to request it.
2. **Automatic UI Updates**: When the server sends a message via WebSocket, our client-side JavaScript can listen for these messages and update the UI automatically. This is much more efficient than making a database call and refreshing the page or part of the page every time we need new data.
3. **Real-Time Interaction**: For example, if a new job is created or an existing job's status is updated, the server can immediately notify the client via WebSocket. Our client-side script can then update the relevant part of the web page in real-time, without needing to reload the page or manually trigger an AJAX call.
