Great, let's create the `jobs` table to capture the job scheduling information, with fields for the client, address, date, start time, end time, job type, job frequency, instructions, notes, and billing info.

### Proposed PostgreSQL Schema for Jobs Table

We'll need to reference the `clients` table to link each job to a specific client. Additionally, we'll add fields for job frequency and other details as described.

#### Jobs Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- Reference to clients table
    address VARCHAR(255), -- Address of the job, typically derived from the client's address
    job_date DATE NOT NULL, -- Date of the job
    start_time TIME NOT NULL, -- Start time of the job
    end_time TIME NOT NULL, -- End time of the job
    job_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (job_type IN ('Deep', 'Office', 'Vacation Place')), -- Job type, color coded
    job_frequency VARCHAR(20) CHECK (job_frequency IN ('One-time', 'Weekly', 'Bi-weekly', 'Monthly')), -- Job frequency
    days_of_week VARCHAR(10)[], -- Days of the week for recurring jobs
    schedule_duration INT, -- How far out to schedule, in weeks
    team_instructions TEXT, -- Instructions for the team
    admin_notes TEXT, -- Administrator only notes
    billing_info TEXT, -- Billing info
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    CONSTRAINT check_times CHECK (start_time < end_time) -- Ensure start time is before end time
);
```

### Explanation of Fields

1. **id**: Auto-incrementing primary key.
2. **client_id**: Foreign key reference to the `clients` table.
3. **address**: Address of the job, typically the client's address.
4. **job_date**: Date of the job.
5. **start_time**: Start time of the job.
6. **end_time**: End time of the job.
7. **job_type**: Type of job (Deep, Office, Vacation Place), color-coded.
8. **job_frequency**: Frequency of the job (One-time, Weekly, Bi-weekly, Monthly).
9. **days_of_week**: Array of days of the week for recurring jobs.
10. **schedule_duration**: How far out to schedule, in weeks.
11. **team_instructions**: Instructions for the team.
12. **admin_notes**: Administrator-only notes.
13. **billing_info**: Billing information.
14. **created_at**: Timestamp for when the record was created.
15. **updated_at**: Timestamp for when the record was last updated.

### Steps to Implement

1. **Set Up PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your local machine.
2. **Create the Database**: Create a database for your project.
3. **Create the Table**: Run the SQL script to create the `jobs` table.

### SQL Script Execution

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -h localhost
   ```

2. **Create Database**:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   \c your_database_name
   ```

3. **Create Jobs Table**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE jobs (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       address VARCHAR(255),
       job_date DATE NOT NULL,
       start_time TIME NOT NULL,
       end_time TIME NOT NULL,
       job_type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (job_type IN ('Deep', 'Office', 'Vacation Place')),
       job_frequency VARCHAR(20) CHECK (job_frequency IN ('One-time', 'Weekly', 'Bi-weekly', 'Monthly')),
       days_of_week VARCHAR(10)[],
       schedule_duration INT,
       team_instructions TEXT,
       admin_notes TEXT,
       billing_info TEXT,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       CONSTRAINT check_times CHECK (start_time < end_time)
   );
   ```

### Example CRUD Operations

**Insert a New Job**:
```sql
INSERT INTO jobs (
    client_id, address, job_date, start_time, end_time, job_type, job_frequency, days_of_week, schedule_duration, team_instructions, admin_notes, billing_info
) VALUES (
    1, '123 Main St', '2023-12-01', '09:00', '12:00', 'Deep', 'Weekly', ARRAY['Mon', 'Wed', 'Fri'], 4, 'Bring all equipment', 'Admin only note', 'Credit Card'
);
```

**Select All Jobs**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM jobs;
```

### Notes on Monthly Jobs with Exclamation Sign

To implement a visual indicator (like an exclamation mark) for monthly jobs until they are confirmed, you can add a boolean field `is_confirmed` to the `jobs` table:

#### Updated Jobs Table with Confirmation Field

```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN is_confirmed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Summary

This setup creates a `jobs` table that includes all the fields necessary to manage job scheduling, linked to the `clients` table. The schema includes constraints to ensure data integrity, such as ensuring the start time is before the end time. You can now proceed to implement CRUD operations and other application logic to manage jobs effectively.
