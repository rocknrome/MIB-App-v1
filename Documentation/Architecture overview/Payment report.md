To create the "Payments Report," we'll need to add a field to the `jobs` table to track the payment status and the method of payment. Then, we'll create a function to generate the report, which includes listing each job with its payment status and method of payment. Finally, we'll handle the notification for unpaid jobs.

### Updated `jobs` Table

Add fields to track payment status and method of payment.

```sql
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE jobs ADD COLUMN payment_method VARCHAR(50) CHECK (payment_method IN ('Credit Card', 'Zelle', 'Venmo', 'Check', 'Cash'));
```

### Payments Report Table

Create a table to store the daily payments report.

```sql
CREATE TABLE payments_reports (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    report_date DATE NOT NULL,
    job_id INT REFERENCES jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    client_id INT REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    job_date DATE NOT NULL,
    job_description TEXT,
    is_paid BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    payment_method VARCHAR(50),
    notification_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Function to Generate Payments Report

This function generates the payments report and sends notifications for unpaid jobs.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_payments_report() RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    current_date DATE := CURRENT_DATE;
    job RECORD;
    total_jobs_completed INT;
BEGIN
    -- Calculate total jobs completed
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total_jobs_completed
    FROM jobs
    WHERE job_date = current_date AND completion_status = TRUE;

    -- Insert total jobs completed into payments_reports table
    INSERT INTO payments_reports (report_date, job_description)
    VALUES (current_date, 'Total Jobs Completed: ' || total_jobs_completed);

    -- Iterate over each job
    FOR job IN
        SELECT j.id, j.client_id, j.job_date, j.address, j.is_paid, j.payment_method
        FROM jobs j
        WHERE j.job_date = current_date AND j.completion_status = TRUE
    LOOP
        -- Insert job details into payments_reports table
        INSERT INTO payments_reports (report_date, job_id, client_id, job_date, job_description, is_paid, payment_method)
        VALUES (current_date, job.id, job.client_id, job.job_date, job.address, job.is_paid, job.payment_method);

        -- Send notification for unpaid jobs
        IF job.is_paid = FALSE THEN
            PERFORM send_payment_reminder(job.client_id, job.id);
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Function to Send Payment Reminder

This function sends a payment reminder via SMS to the client.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION send_payment_reminder(client_id INT, job_id INT) RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    client RECORD;
    job RECORD;
BEGIN
    -- Get client and job details
    SELECT * INTO client FROM clients WHERE id = client_id;
    SELECT * INTO job FROM jobs WHERE id = job_id;

    -- Send SMS (this is a placeholder; actual implementation will depend on the SMS service used)
    PERFORM send_sms(client.phone, 'Reminder: Please pay for your job completed on ' || job.job_date || '.');

    -- Update notification_sent in payments_reports table
    UPDATE payments_reports
    SET notification_sent = TRUE
    WHERE job_id = job_id AND report_date = CURRENT_DATE;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Scheduled Task to Run at End of Day

You can schedule the `generate_payments_report` function to run at the end of each day using PostgreSQL's `pg_cron` extension or an external cron job.

### Setting Up pg_cron (if available)

```sql
-- Install pg_cron extension (if not already installed)
CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

-- Schedule the generate_payments_report function to run daily at 6 PM
SELECT cron.schedule('generate_payments_report', '0 18 * * *', 'CALL generate_payments_report()');
```

### Summary

1. **Track Payment Status**: Added `is_paid` and `payment_method` fields to the `jobs` table.
2. **Payments Report Table**: Created a `payments_reports` table to store the daily payments report.
3. **Generate Payments Report**: Created a function `generate_payments_report` to generate the daily payments report and send notifications for unpaid jobs.
4. **Send Payment Reminders**: Created a function `send_payment_reminder` to send SMS reminders to clients.
5. **Scheduled Task**: Set up a scheduled task to run the report generation function daily.

This setup ensures that you can track payment status, generate a daily payments report, and send reminders for unpaid jobs. If you need any further adjustments or additional features, please let me know!
