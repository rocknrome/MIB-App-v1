**Traditional approach vs modern approach**

In a traditional setup, we rely on synchronous operations where each service or part of the application waits for a response before proceeding, which can lead to issues like bottlenecks, data integrity concerns, and difficulties in scaling, especially with multiple users performing operations simultaneously.

By integrating Kafka, we decouple the services and handle operations asynchronously. Kafka ensures that messages (events) are reliably delivered and processed in order, maintaining the integrity of the data flow. This approach helps us to avoid the pitfalls of synchronous systems, like race conditions and inconsistent states, especially in high-concurrency environments.

In essence, Kafka adds a robust layer to our application, allowing it to handle complex workflows, maintain data consistency, and scale more effectively while keeping the data flow and integrity intact.
